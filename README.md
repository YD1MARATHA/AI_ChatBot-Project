Project Description:

The AI Chatbot project is an intelligent conversational agent designed to interact with users and provide 
assistance, information, and engagement through natural language conversations. Using advanced Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) techniques, the chatbot is capable of understanding user inputs, generating contextually relevant 
responses, and continuously learning to improve its performance.

* Specifications:

Backend Technologies: Python with libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or TensorFlow for NLP processing.
Frontend Interface: Web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Instructions for Using the Project:

* Setup and Installation:

Install Python on your local machine if not already installed.
Set up a virtual environment for the project to manage dependencies.
Install the necessary Python libraries for NLP processing (e.g., NLTK, spaCy, TensorFlow).
Clone or download the project files from the repository.
Training the Chatbot (Optional):

Train the chatbot using existing datasets or customize training data for specific domains or use cases.
Utilize machine learning models for improving chatbot responses and understanding user intent.

* Integration and Deployment:

Integrate the chatbot with a web-based frontend.
Deploy the chatbot on a hosting platform or server for public or private access.

* User Interaction:

Access the chatbot interface through the web browser.
Start a conversation with the chatbot by typing messages or asking questions in natural language.
Engage in interactive dialogues, receive responses, and provide feedback to enhance chatbot capabilities.
